**Building my path through tech — one command, one mistake, one “aha!” at a time.**

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub!  
Here I’m documenting my journey of learning, testing, and building.  
Most of my current focus is on **Microsoft Intune**, **M365**, **automation**, and slowly teaching myself **Python** 
(it’s a patient love story, not a fast one 😅).

## 🧭 About this space

This repo works as a **living portfolio** — a mix of experiments, notes, and real-world troubleshooting from my IT path.  
Even the smallest scripts or write-ups are part of the bigger picture: proving that tech can be both **pretty and powerful**.

## 🐍 What I’m learning

| Area | Current Status | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| **Python** | Beginner | Working through logic basics, automating small things |
| **PowerShell** | Intermediate | Using it for device management & automation ideas |
| **M365 / Intune** | Growing daily | Building my own virtual lab |
| **Cybersecurity** | Curious | Learning through Microsoft Learn + TryHackMe |



## 🌙 Vision

To turn this learning path into something educational and inspiring —  
for myself, and for anyone else proving that curiosity and persistence matter more than titles.
