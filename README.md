# 🌸 SheLovesTechy - Karita J.

**Building my path through tech — one command, one mistake, one “aha!” at a time.**

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub!  

# 💗 My Path in Progress

I’m Karita — a Service Desk Specialist (L1) who solves problems for a living and studies code for fun.  
My days revolve around user support, Intune, M365, troubleshooting, and the tiny invisible things that keep companies running.  
My evenings are for HTML, React, JSON, UI design, and slowly building my way into front-end development. 🌿

I’m creating a future where my IT experience and my creative side meet in one path.  
No rushing — just learning, building, and documenting the journey. ☕

## 🧭 About This Space

This repository is my **living portfolio**.  
A place where I collect experiments, notes, small UI components, troubleshooting moments, and reflections from my life in IT.

It’s not about perfection.  
It’s about progress — one tiny piece at a time.

I also write reflections on my blog:

## 🌙 Vision

To grow into a role where design, logic, and modern workplace tech come together —  
and to show that a self-built path can be both beautiful and powerful.

Every step here is part of a transformation.  
And it’s only getting brighter from here. 💗
