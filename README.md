**Building my path through tech — one command, one mistake, one “aha!” at a time.**

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub!  

🩷 **My Path in Progress**  
I’m currently working as a Service Desk Specialist (L1), helping users and keeping things running behind the scenes.  
In my free time, I’m diving deeper into Microsoft Intune, M365, and automation — learning how to manage devices smarter and fix issues more efficiently.  🌿

I’m still figuring out where this path leads — maybe towards endpoint administration, consulting, or modern workplace management.  
For now, I’m focusing on learning, experimenting, and growing through every challenge I face. ☕

## 🧭 About this space

This repo works as a **living portfolio** — a mix of experiments, notes, and real-world troubleshooting from my IT path.  
Even the smallest scripts or write-ups are part of the bigger picture: proving that tech can be both **pretty and powerful**.

I also write longer reflections and guides on my blog:
