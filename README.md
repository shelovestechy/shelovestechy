## 🌿 Where I’m headed

I’m creating a future where my IT experience and my creative side meet on one path.  
No rushing — just learning, building, and documenting the journey. ☕

I’m already deep in observing how systems behave over time.  
This space is where I slowly gather what I learn, piece by piece.

## 🧭 About This Space

This repository is my **living portfolio / notebook**.

A place where I collect:
- experiments and small builds  
- notes and diagrams  
- troubleshooting moments  
- reflections from everyday work in IT  

It’s not about perfection.  
It’s about progress — one tiny piece at a time.

Some things here are unfinished on purpose.  
They’re snapshots of thinking in motion.

## 🌱 What I’m Learning (right now)

These are not checklists or courses.  
They are areas I keep returning to, because they keep revealing new layers.

| Area | Depth | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| **Identity lifecycle** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ | Watching how joiners, movers, and leavers behave over time |
| **Access & boundaries** | ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ | Where responsibility shifts quietly, and where it fades |
| **Everyday systems** | ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ | Observing how small decisions age in real environments |
| **Automation & logic** | ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ | Seeing what gets amplified when humans step aside |
| **Data & structure** | ⭐⭐☆☆☆ | How identity travels between systems through data |
| **Documentation** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ | Writing to think, not to impress |
| **UI & clarity** | ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ | Making complex ideas readable and humane |

This table is meant to change.  
If a row disappears, it usually means I’ve understood it well enough to move on.

## 🔮 Tools & concepts I want to explore next

Not to collect technologies —  
but to understand where decisions are actually made.

| Tool / Concept | Curiosity | Why |
|----------------|-----------|-----|
| **Authentication protocols** | ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ | To see where trust is created — and where it isn’t |
| **Authorization models** | ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ | How intent turns into rules and exceptions |
| **Identity automation** | ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ | What scales cleanly, and what quietly breaks |
| **Infrastructure as code** | ⭐⭐☆☆☆ | When identity becomes part of infrastructure |
| **Identity experience (UX)** | ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ | How friction and clarity shape real behavior |

No deadlines here.  
Just threads I keep pulling when something feels worth understanding deeper.

## 🌙 Vision

Every step here is part of a transformation.  
Not a dramatic one — a quiet, steady one.

I’m learning to trust slow progress,  
to value depth over speed,  
and to let understanding accumulate naturally.

And yes — it’s only getting brighter from here. 💗
